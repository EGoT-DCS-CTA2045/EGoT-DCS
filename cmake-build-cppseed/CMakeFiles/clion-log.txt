CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /tmp/tmp.gfzrIsc77v/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/Users/whits/STUFF/Local_Env/local_EGoT-raspi-control/EGoT-DCS where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
